            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p>This page explores the abundance and nativeness of species in California's National Parks, allowing us to
                explore how this plays into biodiversity and th preservation of these parks' ecosystems.</p>
            <h4>Abundance and Nativeness</h4>
            <iframe src="heatmap.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p>This interactive heatmap shows use the species count data categorized by abundance and nativeness between
                the three parks.
                Users can toggle between radio buttons to show the species count, abundance, and nativeness for each
                park. The x-axis represents the abundance
                categories, while the y-axis represents nativeness. The blue color gradient indicates the number of
                species corresponding to each combination of abundance and
                nativeness, allowing users to easily identify areas with high or low species counts. This intersection
                of abundance and nativeness provides a detailed, categorical view of species distribution, offering
                valuable insights for biodiversity analysis.
                By highlighting patterns in species distribution, the
                heatmap helps inform conservation and management efforts, particularly in areas where invasive species
                may be dominating. Invasive species often display irregular abundance patterns, such as appearing
                suddenly in previously underrepresented categories, and this visualization can act as an early warning
                system for such disruptions. By focusing on anomalies or unexplained increases in abundance, park
                managers and ecologists can prioritize further investigation and develop targeted strategies to control
                invasive species before they spread, supporting ecosystem preservation.</p>
