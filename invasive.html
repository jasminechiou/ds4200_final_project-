            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p>This page explores the abundance and nativeness of species in California's National Parks, allowing us to
                explore how this plays into biodiversity and the preservation of these parks' ecosystems.</p>
            <h4>Abundance and Nativeness</h4>
            <iframe src="heatmap.html" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p>This interactive heatmap shows use the species count data categorized by abundance and nativeness between
                the three parks.
                Users can toggle between radio buttons to show the species count, abundance, and nativeness for each
                park. The x-axis represents the abundance
                categories, while the y-axis represents nativeness. The blue color gradient indicates the number of
                species corresponding to each combination of abundance and
                nativeness, allowing users to easily identify areas with high or low species counts. This intersection
                of abundance and nativeness provides a detailed, categorical view of species distribution, offering
                valuable insights for biodiversity analysis.
                By highlighting patterns in species distribution, the
                heatmap helps inform conservation and management efforts, particularly in areas where invasive species
                may be dominating. Invasive species often display irregular abundance patterns, such as appearing
                suddenly in previously underrepresented categories, and this visualization can act as an early warning
                system for such disruptions. By focusing on anomalies or unexplained increases in abundance, park
                managers and ecologists can prioritize further investigation and develop targeted strategies to control
                invasive species before they spread, supporting ecosystem preservation.</p>
            <h4>A Closer Look</h4>
            <iframe src="sankey.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p>This Sankey Diagram takes a closer look at abundance and nativeness by zooming into which orders are both
                abundant and non-native. Orders are one level of the Linnaeus classification system that is used to
                classify animals into a hierarchical tree. The Sankey Diagram looks at these orders and connects them to
                which category they are in, as well as which park they come from (these are the nodes). This plot is
                also interactive- the user can click nodes to highlight the connected edges, hover over the nodes to get
                more information, and even drag around the nodes to better visualize whatever aspect they want to dig
                deeper
                into. What we can learn from this visualization is that most of the non-native and abundant/common
                species
                are Vascular Plants, specifically those from the Poales order. Poales are flowering plants and includes
                plants such as various grasses. This tells us that if these national parks want to limit any invasive
                species, this is one place they could start. This could be especially important because Poales can have
                negative effects on wildlife, water cycles, and the economy by disrupting agriculture.</p>
