            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p>This page explores the abundance and nativeness of species in California's National Parks, allowing us to
                explore how this plays into biodiversity and th preservation of these parks' ecosystems.</p>
            <h4>Abundance and Nativeness</h4>
            <iframe src="heatmap.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
            <iframe src="park_species_interactive_abundance_chart.html" width = "100%" height = "600"></iframe>
            <p>In this visualization we are examining the total species count across abundance categories for three national parks.
                The stacked bar chart and scatter plot categorizes species by abundance levels, such as abundant, common, occasional, rare
                uncommon, and unknown. Each bar segment represents the contribution of each species counts from individual parks which offer a 
                comparative view of biodiversity throughout these parks.
            </p>
            <p> The patterns displayed in this graph could help identify potential invasive species, because invasive species often exhibit 
                irregular abundance patterns. They may suddenly appear in abundant or occasional categories when they were previously 
                absent or underrepresented. This visualization allows for park managers and ecologists to monitor the shifts in species abundance,
                which can act as an early indicator of invasive species disrupting ecosystems. By focusing on abundance anomolies or unexplained 
                increses in certain categories, stakeholders can prioritize further investigation and create targeted strategies to manage invasive 
                species before they spread.
