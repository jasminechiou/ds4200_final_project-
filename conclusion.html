            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Calfornia's national parks have rich biodiversity, but there are still large gaps in species documentation. These gaps are concerning because 
                thorough documentation is crucial in identifying and addressing the presence of invasive species, that pose a serious threat to ecosystems and native 
                biodiversity. Protecting these parks requires ongoing efforts to monitor species diversity, abundance, and distribution.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Species Richness: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park has the highest number of species richness</li>
                <li>Species Count Across Parks by Category: Shows that all three parks have the highest amount of unique vascular plants.  </li>
                <li>Combined Vouchers and References by Park and Category: Redwood National Park shows a broader spread of combined vouchers and references counts across species 
                    categories, suggesting a more balanced distribution of recorded species.</li>
                <li>Heatmap of Species Count by Abundance and Nativeness: Joshua Tree National Park has the most common native species, suggesting ecosystem stability. 
                    In contrast, Redwood National Park has a high number of Unknown species, making an unknown treat of invasive species more likely. </li>
                <li>Non-Native Abundant Species: Of all the non-native species, most are vascular plants, specifially Poales, and most are from Redwood 
                    National Park. Thus, any efforts to limit abundant non-native species should focus on Poales and at Redwood. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These visualizations show the urgent need to improve species documentation in Calfornia's national parks to protect their biodiversity
                and address and mitigate threats of invasive species. By identifying these threats, park rangers and managers can better preserve the ecological balance, maintain species 
                richness, and ensure the long-term health and resilience of these vital natural areas for everyone to enjoy for many more years to come.

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>Future plans for this project involve including more California National Parks to further the depth and breadth of the research.
                We also would like to create a map representation of the data to add a different type of visualization. Lastly, we did 
                preliminary research into calculating our own metrics of biodiversity from the dataset, such as a Shannon Diversity Index, 
                which be a unique way to compare the parks that we choose to evaluate.
            </p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>One limitation of our project is the data collection methods. We do not know that there is a standardized method across parks, 
                so any comparisons between parks need be taken with a grain of salt. Additionally, while our dataset has both categorical and 
                continuous variables, there are fewer continuous ones, so merging with another dataset of species information may provide more 
                numerical data for deeper and more interesting analyses.
