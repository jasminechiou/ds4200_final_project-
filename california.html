            <h2>About California's Diverse Species</h2>
            <p>This page highlights the vast biodiversity in the 3 selected national parks: Joshua Tree,
                Sequoia/Kings Canyon, and Redwood National Parks. Take a look at some interesting plots relating to
                biodiversity that reveal fascinating things about the NPSpecies data!</p>

            <h3>Species Richness in our 3 Parks</h3>
            <img src="static_plots/species_richness.png" alt="Unique Species">

            <p>This plot introduces, at a high level, the distribution of unique species in these three national parks.
                As we can see, Joshua Tree has the least while Sequoia has the most. This tells us that even within
                California, these are differences in species richness between national parks. Another thing that this
                tells us about biodiversity in California is that Sequoia National Park may span a broader range
                different ecosystems, which allows for a greater diversity of species. In contrast, Joshua Tree
                National Park is mostly situated in desert regions with a more arid climate, which limits the variety
                of species that can survive.</p>

            <h3>A Closer Look at Species Category in our Parks</h3>
            <img src="static_plots/d3_barplot.png" alt="d3">

            <p>The species in this data are categorized into six groups: amphibian, bird, fish, mammal, reptile, and
                vascular plant. It is evident through this visualization that the Vascular Plant category dominates
                the rest of the graph. It has the largest number of species across all three parks, with the
                vascular plant family having over 1400 unique species in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National
                Park. The bird family is the next most populated, with all three parks having comparable
                numbers. In addition, the Amphibian family has the smallest number of unique species across
                all 3 parks with values that are all near 0. Consequently, these results make it clear that there is
                a low amphibian population across California. Similarly, fish and reptile populations also have
                low counts with similar distributions for all three parks. However, the fish category has an
                interesting distribution as the fish in Redwood National Park being the outlier in the fish category
                with around 200 unique species. As Sequoia National Park has little to no fish, while Joshua
                Tree National Park has no fish.</p>

            <h3>Vouchers and References</h3>
            <img src="static_plots/boxplot.png" alt="Box Plot">
            <p>This boxplot visualization displays the combined counts of vouchers and references across various
                categories in the three national parks. The visualization highlights variations in species documentation
                across parks and categories. The boxplot also has zero outliers because they may indicate gaps in
                species
                surveys or a lack of physical evidence for certain species in the parks. These gaps indicate the
                importance of
                expanding documentation efforts, especially in categories with low representation. By analyzing the
                distribution
                of vouchers and references, park managers can identify underrepresented species groups and prioritize
                the future
                research or conservation efforts to ensure comprehensive biodiversity records.
