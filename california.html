            <h2>About California'a Diverse Species</h2>
            <p>This page highlights the vast biodiversity in the 3 selected national parks: Joshua Tree,
                Sequoia/Kings Canyon, and Redwood National Parks. Below is a look at ... [FINISH THIS]</p>
            <img src="static_plots/d3_barplot.png" alt="d3">

            <p>This bar chart’s data is categorized into six groups: amphibian, bird, fish, mammal, reptile, and
                vascular plant. It’s evident through this visualization that the Vascular Plant category dominates
                the rest of the graph. It has the largest number of species across all three parks, with the
                vascular plant family having over 1400 unique species in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National
                Park. The bird family is the next most populated, with all three parks having comparable
                numbers. In addition, the Amphibian family has the smallest number of unique species across
                all 3 parks with values that are all near 0. Consequently, these results make it clear that there is
                a low amphibian population across California. Similarly, fish and reptile populations also have
                low counts with similar distributions for all three parks. However, the fish category has an
                interesting distribution as the fish in Redwood National Park being the outlier in the fish category
                with around 200 unique species. As Sequoia National Park has little to no fish, while Joshua
                Tree National Park has no fish.</p>

            <h3>Vouchers and References</h3>
            <img src="static_plots/boxplot.png" alt="Box Plot">
            <p>This boxplot visualization displays the combined counts of vouchers and references across various
                categories in the three national parks. The visualization highlights variations in species documentation
                across parks and categories. The boxplot also has zero outliers because they may indicate gaps in
                species
                surveys or a lack of physical evidence for certain species in the parks. These gaps indicate the
                importance of
                expanding documentation efforts, especially in categories with low representation. By analyzing the
                distribution
                of vouchers and references, park managers can identify underrepresented species groups and prioritize
                the future
                research or conservation efforts to ensure comprehensive biodiversity records.

            <img src="static_plots/species_richness_by_abundance.png" alt="Species by Abundance">
            
            <p> This bar chart’s data is categorized into abundant, common, occasional, rare, uncommon, and
                unknown. The common category is the only category with all 3 national parks having over 200
                unique species. For the uncommon category, the graph reaches its peak, as Sequoia and Kings
                National Park has the most with over 800 unique species. In addition, Redwood National Park
                has an interestingly high amount of unknown unique species, as it doesn’t know the abundance
                of over 400 unique species. The low amount of values for all 3 national parks in the abundant
                category indicates that there aren't many species that are common and abundant everywhere.</p>
