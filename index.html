            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Visualizing Biodiversity in California National Parks, where you can explore various
                visualizations that demonstrate biodiversity and other species-related information such as abundance,
                nativeness, and more! This topic is interesting because biodiversity is key to having healthy
                ecosystems, which includes providing humans with clean air, water, food, medicine, and a stable climate
                in addition to the millions of other species on Earth. Focusing on biodiversity specifically in U.S.
                National Parks can give us valuable insights into how protected areas contribute to the preservation of
                diverse species and ecosystems. National Parks serve as crucial refuges for wildlife and plant species,
                many of which are threatened by human activities like deforestation, urbanization, and climate change.
                By studying biodiversity in these parks, we can better understand the impact of conservation efforts,
                inform future policies, and highlight the importance of preserving natural habitats not only for
                ecological balance but also for sustaining human well-being.</p>
            <h2>Project Goals/Tasks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Compare biodiversity in each of the 3 chosen parks</li>
                <li>Explore nativeness and abundance of species in each of the 3 parks</li>
                <li>Evaluate the status of biodiversity in California and opportunities for improvement</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Data Source, Size, and Attributes</h2>
            <p>The data for this project comes from the National Park Service, which is a branch of the U.S. Department
                of the Interior.
                The specific project that the data comes from is called <a
                    href="https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/">“NPSpecies”</a>.
                NPSpecies is the National Park Service’s web-based tool for documenting the occurrence and status of
                species in U.S. national parks, and provides a way to build, manage, maintain, and share these park
                species lists by allowing users to filter specific parks, species type, etc. and export the data to an
                Excel/CSV file. All of the data on NPSpecies comes from an official government source, so it can be
                considered both reputable and accurate. The NPSpecies tool allows you to get, at most, information for
                all plant and animal species from all national parks in the United States. However, for the purposes of
                our project, this would result in too many rows, so we chose to focus on only three national parks in
                California, since California has the most biodiversity of any state. Narrowing down the objective of our
                project and filtering our data accordingly helps us have a more manageable dataset and a more focused
                project. </p>
    
            <h2>Quick View of Data</h2>

            <iframe src="df_head.html" width="100%" height="420px"></iframe>
            <p>Each row is one species that has been observed, including plants and animals. The 33 total columns
                include information such as the species category, scientific name, common name, occurrence, nativeness,
                and abundance, but not all 33 are useful to our analysis since a few are incomplete or repetitive. The
                final number of columns in our data is 26 along with 4424 rows. </p>

                linked here
            </a> describes an ongoing debate regarding which natural ecosystems to protect and to what extent they should be protected. The paper asserts that local stakeholders should determine and prioritize which natural habitats should be conserved by measuring the levels of biodiversity, natural vegetation, and ecological value in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The hope is to create national conservation plans that are made more effective by incorporating these analyses of biodiversity elements. This paper ultimately calls for increased analyses and studies on biodiversity like the work we plan on doing for this project.
                </p>
            
            <p> The second paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-015-0941-5">linked here </a> highlights an additional reason for why studying and preserving biodiversity in national parks is beneficial. The Finnish study found that national parks with high biodiversity values were more attractive for visitors than parks with lower biodiversity, and the number of annual visits was positively associated with the number of different habitat types and species. Thus, not only does the ecological environment improve for all species and humans, but biodiversity also increases the natural aesthetics of the park and attracts more visitors, which the national parks depend upon for revenue. This provides an additional reason why projects such as ours that focus on biodiversity in national parks can be beneficial.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Calfornia's national parks have rich biodiversity, but there are still large gaps in species documentation. These gaps are concerning because 
                thorough documentation is crucial in identifying and addressing the presence of invasive species, that pose a serious threat to ecosystems and native 
                biodiversity. Protecting these parks requires ongoing efforts to monitor species diversity, abundance, and distribution.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Species Count Across Parks by Category: Shows that all three parks have the highest amount of unique vascular plants.  </li>
                <li>Combined Vouchers and References by Park and Category: Redwood National Park shows a broader spread of combined vouchers and references counts across species 
                    categories, suggesting a more balanced distribution of recorded species.
                </li>
                <li>Species Family: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park has the highest number of species richness</li>
                <li>Species Richness by Abundance in National Parks: Redwood National Park has a large amount of unknown species</li>
                <li>Heatmap of Species Count by Abundance and Nativeness: Joshua Tree National Park has the most common native species, suggesting ecosystem stability. 
                    In contrast, Redwood National Park has a high number of Unknown species, making an unknown treat of invasive species more likely. </li>
                <li>Non-Native Abundant Species: </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These visualizations show the urgent need to improve species documentation in Calfornia's national parks to protect their biodiversity
                and address and mitigate threats of invasive species. By identifying these threats, park rangers and managers can better preserve the ecological balance, maintian species 
                richness, and ensure the long-term heald and resilience of these vital natural areas for everyone to enjoy for many more years to come.
